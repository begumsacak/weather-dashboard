# Weather-dashboard
A weather app built with [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) that can be used to get weather information for multiple cities. A user can type the name of the city to the search bar, and they will be given specific information on weather forecast such as temperature (in metric system), humidity, windspeed, and uv index. The five day forecast for the city will appear at the bottom. The past searches will be saved to the page through local storage.
